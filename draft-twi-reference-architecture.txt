            Trusted Workload Identity Reference Architecture
                draft-twi-reference-architecture-latest

Abstract

   Technological advancement coupled with security concerns demands more
   and more use cases, that require data-in-use protections.  In
   addition, regulatory bodies around the world increasingly require
   data-in-use protection and privacy enhancing technologies.  As these
   advanced technologies are being deployed, challenge remains how to
   identify the workloads and put trust behind them?  This draft will
   address the core issue of managing a trustworthy workload identity
   meeting Confidential Computing requirements.

2.1.  Glossary

   This document uses the following terms:

3.  TWI Use Cases

   Following are some of the use cases demanding trustworthy workload
   identity.

   1.  A ML Model Owner (acting as Relying Party) wants to deploy its
       Workload with a unique identity in a privacy preserving manner.
       It needs to ensure that the deployed workload is operating in an
       environment with certain security guarantees, such as isolated
       from cloud hosting environment and can be periodically attested.

   2.  A Workload operating as a deployed lambda running in an isolated
       environment.

4.  Core Requirements

4.1.  Workload composition

4.2.  Workload lifespan

   Trusted Workload Identity system
