            Trusted Workload Identity Reference Architecture
                draft-twi-reference-architecture-latest

Abstract

   Technological advancement coupled with security concerns demands more
   and more use cases, that require data-in-use protections.  In
   addition regulatory bodies around the world increasingly require
   data-in-use protection and privacy enhancing technologies.
   Correspondingly, there is an increased push to harmonize management
   and governance of human and non-human identities.  This draft will
   address the core issue of managing workload identity in context of
   Confidential Computing requirements.
