--- abstract
Technological advancement coupled with security concerns demands more and more use cases, that require data-in-use protections.
In addition, regulatory bodies around the world increasingly require data-in-use protection and privacy enhancing technologies.
As these advanced technologies are being deployed, challenge remains how to identify the workloads and put trust behind them?
This draft will address the core issue of managing a trustworthy workload identity meeting Confidential Computing requirements.

# TWI Use Cases
Following are some of the use cases demanding trustworthy workload identity.

1. A ML Model Owner (acting as Relying Party) wants to deploy its Workload with a unique identity in a privacy
preserving manner. It needs to ensure that the deployed workload is operating in an environment with certain
security guarantees, such as isolated from cloud hosting environment and can be periodically attested.


2. A Workload operating as a deployed lambda running in an isolated environment.
